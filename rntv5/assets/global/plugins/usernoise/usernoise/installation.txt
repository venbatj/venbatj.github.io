= Installation =

Please note: when I refer to "usernoise folder" I mean the one laying next to this file.
Feel free to ask me on karev.n@gmail.com if you experience any problems.

1. Open usernoise/config.php, edit it to your needs with text editor of your choise. Please note the next:
	* You need PHP 5.2 with json extension in order to run Usernoise. Currently, it is already installed on almost all web servers by default.
	* By default, config.php is configured for using Gmail account, and you just need to put Gmail address and password there.
	* In most other cases, you'll have to set up SMTP-based email delivery. You'll need to know your SMTP server address,
		security scheme (SSL mostly), and your login / password to authenticate at that server. 
2. Save your changes.
3. Upload usernoise folder to your site root. It is better not to rename the folder.
4. Open addme.html with the text editor of your choise.
5. Remove <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script> from the third line if you already have jQuery in your pages.
6. If you renamed your usernoise folder - please replace all /usernoise/ inclusions with your folder name. 
7. Change config options if you need (they are documented inside the file).
8. Copy the code and paste it inside <head> section of your HTML page(s).
9. Try it!

= Important! Gmail setup =

After installing Usernoise with Google account setup, you need to carefully go through the next steps to make it work:

1. Open feedback window, and send some feedback.
2. Open your Gmail account using your _browser_. It's essential to use the _desktop browser_, not mail app or mobile phone.
3. You'll see a "malicious login attempt" message in your inbox. Follow the directions inside.
4. If anything will go wrong - review your Gmail security settings at this page: <https://myaccount.google.com/security>
